# Filter By Category

## Description
The Filter By Category extension is for CMS Opencart 3.x Admin Panel. It allows to filter products by categories.

The extension has been tested with OC 3.0.2.0 and default template, but should work with other OC 3.x and default-compatible templates and can be easily modified for newer OC versions and custom templates.

Please feel free to contact me on Opencart Marketplace through the form "GET SUPPORT" or comments (see links below).
